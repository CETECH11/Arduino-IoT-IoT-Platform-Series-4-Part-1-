The Arduino IoT Cloud is an online platform that makes it easy for us to create, deploy and monitor IoT projects. The platform allows anyone to create IoT projects, with a user-friendly interface, and an all-in-one solution for configuration, writing code, uploading, and visualization.

Their service allows us to configure, program and deploy our Arduino devices. An all-in-one solution for IoT development, where we can build visual dashboards to monitor and control our devices, integrate with other services, and much more.

Arduino IoT Cloud has features that work in real-time and can be done all from a single point of contact, i.e. the Cloud. No more having to repeatedly upload the code to the Wireless Device. Upload it once, and you're good to go! But what else does it offer? Let's have a look -

Data Monitoring - Easily monitor our Arduino's sensor values through a dashboard. Using a Mobile phone or a PC.
Over-The-Air (OTA) Uploads - Upload code to the connected devices over the internet
Webhooks - HTTP REST APIs help us to integrate our project with any third-party service. This gives a scope to use the IoT from a broader perspective
Amazon Alexa Support - Link the project, voice-controlled with the Amazon Alexa integration.
Dashboard Sharing - Share your visualization data with other people around the world.
Variable Synchronisation - Variable synchronization allows us to sync variables across devices, enabling communication between devices with minimal coding.
Scheduler - Schedule any job to go on/off for a specific amount of time (seconds, minutes, hours). Basically, Automate your IoT projects and watch them work on their own on a regular routine you configure!

It is necessary to have a development board that can be connected to the internet. Below is a list of such devices -

ESP32/ESP9266 WiFi (Espressif)
MKR 1000/1010 WiFi (Arduino)
Nano RP2040 Connect (Arduino)
Nano 33 IoT (Arduino)
Portenta H7 (Arduino)
Opta (Arduino)
...and a few other boards
We can choose between using an official Arduino board, or a board based on the ESP32 / ESP8266 SoC. The Arduino IoT Cloud currently supports connection via Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, and mobile telecom networks.
